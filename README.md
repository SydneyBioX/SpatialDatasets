# SpatialDatasets

The `SpatialDatasets` package contains a collection of spatially-resolved omics datasets, which have been formatted into the [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SpatialExperiment), [MoleculeExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MoleculeExperiment) or [CytoImageList](https://bioconductor.org/packages/cytomapper) Bioconductor classes, for use in examples, demonstrations, and tutorials. The datasets are from several different platforms including IMC, MIBI-TOF, Xenium, CosMx and MERFISH. They have been sourced from various publicly available sources.
